## Animals · Counts and Extremes

Time to report some fun animal facts from the provided `animals` array in `main.js`.

Add code that computes and logs:

1) How many animals live at the zoo.
2) The youngest animal’s age.
3) The oldest animal’s age.

Example shape of the output (numbers will differ based on real data):

```txt
***************************************************
*****              A N I M A L S              *****
***************************************************
We currently care for 15 animals at the zoo
The youngest animal is 2 years old
The oldest animal is 99 years old
```

Tip: Prefer small, focused helper functions you can reuse in later steps.
