## Expanding to Animals

Alright! Now that the habitat stats are working, Miranda's ready for phase two of her dashboard dreams: animal facts!

She's excited because—plot twist—you already have all the animal data! Each critter in the array has its own fun properties just waiting to be displayed.

Miranda wants you to whip up some functions that show fun stats for her animals, just like you did for the habitats:

1. How many animals live at the zoo?
2. What's the age of the youngest animal?
3. What's the age of the oldest animal?

### Example Output

When you're done, it should look something like this (note: these numbers are totally made up for demonstration purposes):

```sh
***************************************************
*****              A N I M A L S              *****
***************************************************
We currently care for 2 animals at the zoo
The youngest animal is 28 years old
The oldest animal is 999 years old
```

Tip: Prefer small, focused helper functions you can reuse in later steps.
