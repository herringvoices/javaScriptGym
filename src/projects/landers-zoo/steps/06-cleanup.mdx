## Cleanup & Modularization

Great work building the dashboard features! Before you present to Miranda, clean up the code by splitting it into modules.

In the editor, you’ll now see two new files (unhidden for this step):

- data.js — just the arrays for `habitats` and `animals`
- functions.js — reusable helpers (e.g., total area, smallest/largest, filters)
- main.js — your orchestrator that prints the output by importing from data.js and functions.js

Your task:

1) Move the raw data structures from `main.js` into `data.js` and export them.
2) Move calculation and formatting helpers from `main.js` into `functions.js` and export them.
3) In `main.js`, import the data and functions, then print the same output you’ve been building.

Tip: start by listing the responsibilities in `zoo.js`. Anything that isn’t printing or orchestration likely belongs in `functions.js`.

That’s it! Skip the sequence diagram chapter for this project.
