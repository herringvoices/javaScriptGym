## Presentation to Miranda Lander

Alright, you've built all the features Miranda asked for! Now it's time for the big presentation.

But first... let's talk about your code. Is it currently one giant file that looks like a bowl of spaghetti? Time to clean that up before you show it to the boss!

In the editor, you’ll now see two new files (unhidden for this step):

- data.js — just the arrays for `habitats` and `animals`
- functions.js — reusable helpers (e.g., total area, smallest/largest, filters)
- main.js — your orchestrator that prints the output by importing from data.js and functions.js

Your task:

1) Move the raw data structures from `main.js` into `data.js` and export them.
2) Move calculation and formatting helpers from `main.js` into `functions.js` and export them.
3) In `main.js`, import the data and functions, then print the same output you’ve been building.

Tip: start by listing the responsibilities in `main.js`. Anything that isn’t printing or orchestration likely belongs in `functions.js`.
