## Animals · Age Ranges

Visitors asked for quick groupings by age. Create two filtered lists from `animals`:

- Baby Brigade: animals age 5 or younger.
- Elder Council: animals age 10 or older.

Log the names in each group, one per line, like:

```txt
The youngest animals are
	Hopper the Red-eyed Tree Frog
	Waddles the Gentoo Penguin
	Pingu the Emperor Penguin

The oldest animals are
	Tito the Galápagos Tortoise
	Yeti the Snow Leopard
	Tina the Reticulated Giraffe
```

You can sort the groups if you’d like, but it’s optional.
