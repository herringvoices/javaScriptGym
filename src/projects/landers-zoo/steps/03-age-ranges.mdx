## Helping Visitors Find Age Groups

Miranda just came back from a visitor feedback session (apparently people LOVE giving opinions at zoos). The verdict? Folks want to see which animals are spring chickens and which ones are, well, ancient tortoises.

So! Time to add some filtering magic to your program. You'll need to create two groups based on age:

**The Baby Brigade:** Only animals that are 5 years old or younger.

**The Elder Council:** Only animals that are 10 years old or older.

### Example Output

When you've got it working, your output should look something like this:

```txt
The youngest animals are
	Hopper the Red-eyed Tree Frog
	Waddles the Gentoo Penguin
	Pingu the Emperor Penguin

The oldest animals are
	Tito the Galápagos Tortoise
	Yeti the Snow Leopard
	Tina the Reticulated Giraffe
```

You can sort the groups if you’d like, but it’s optional.
