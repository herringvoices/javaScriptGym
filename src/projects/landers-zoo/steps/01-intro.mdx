## Lander's Zoo · Intro & Habitat Summary

Miranda Lander has always loved animals. Her parents spent much of her childhood visiting wildlife sanctuaries, volunteering at rescue centers, and going on thrilling safari adventures around the world.

When she turned 25, she knew what she wanted to do with the rest of her life - share her love of animals with her community. She decided to start her very own zoo called **_Lander's Zoo_**. As her zoo grew, she started adding more habitats, and her staff quickly expanded.

Miranda knew it was time to start managing her zoo with software. She has hired you as her first software developer after trying to do it herself, and quickly realizing that coding was definitely NOT her superpower.

She's hoping you can finish what she started first by displaying information about the habitats in her zoo.

### Your Task

1. Call each function and store the results.
2. Create a multi-line string (template literal recommended) named `habitatSummary` with this structure (adjust wording if you like):
	 ```
	 We maintain ##### square meters of animal habitats across the zoo.
	 Smallest habitat size: ##### sq meters.
	 Largest habitat size: ##### sq meters.
	 ```
3. Log it once using `console.log(habitatSummary)`.
