## Lander's Zoo · Intro & Habitat Summary

Welcome to Lander's Zoo! For this first step, the habitat functions in `main.js` already work. Your job is to use their return values to compose a single, clean multi-line summary string and log it once.

What you have in the editor:

- `main.js` — contains the habitat data and three working functions:
	- `totalHabitatArea(habitats)` → total area (expected: 11500)
	- `getSmallestHabitatSize(habitats)` → smallest size (expected: 800)
	- `getLargestHabitatSize(habitats)` → largest size (expected: 4000)
- `index.html` — loads the script
- `data.js` & `functions.js` — unused for now; they'll matter in later cleanup/modularization

### Your Task

1. Call each function and store the results (already done for you in variables `totalArea`, `smallest`, `largest`).
2. Create a multi-line string (template literal recommended) named `habitatSummary` with this structure (adjust wording if you like):
	 ```
	 We maintain 11500 square meters of animal habitats across the zoo.
	 Smallest habitat size: 800 sq meters.
	 Largest habitat size: 4000 sq meters.
	 ```
3. Log it once using `console.log(habitatSummary)`.

Hints:
- Prefer a template literal so you can easily express newlines with `\n` or by using the literal line breaks.
- Focus on clarity and consistent units (e.g., `sq meters`).

That’s it — no debugging here. When the summary looks good, move on to the next step to start working with animal stats.
