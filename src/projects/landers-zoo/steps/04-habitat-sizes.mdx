## Helping Visitors Find Habitat Sizes

The comment cards are in! And guess what? Visitors are curious about habitat sizes now. (Apparently people really want to know where the animals have the most room to run around versus where they're in more... cozy quarters.)

Miranda and her team have asked you to add another set of filters to the dashboard. Here's what they need:

**Tiny Town:** Show only habitats where the size is 1500 square meters or less.

**Mega Mansions:** Show only habitats where the size is 3000 square meters or greater.

<Note> **Heads up:** Once you get this working, you might notice something funky in the data. Keep your detective eyes peeled!</Note>

### Example Output

Your output should look kinda like this:

```txt
The smallest habitats are
	Reptile House
	Penguin Cove

The largest habitats are
	Savanna Exhibit
```
