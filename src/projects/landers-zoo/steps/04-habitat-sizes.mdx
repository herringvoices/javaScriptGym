## Habitats · Size Ranges

Add filters for habitat sizes using the `habitats` array:

- Tiny Town: size ≤ 1500 square meters.
- Mega Mansions: size ≥ 3000 square meters.

Print each list with one name per line. Keep an eye out for any data quirks you might uncover once both lists are printing.

Example:

```txt
The smallest habitats are
	Reptile House
	Penguin Cove

The largest habitats are
	Savanna Exhibit
```
