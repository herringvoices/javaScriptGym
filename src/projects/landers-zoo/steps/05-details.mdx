## Habitat & Animal Details

More feedback is in! And Miranda is PUMPED to respond quickly because happy visitors = more donations = better food for the animals = everyone wins!

The people have spoken, and they want DETAILS. Not just numbers—they want the juicy stuff:

**For Habitats:**
1. How big is it?
2. What's the climate?

For animals:
1. How old is it?
2. What does it eat?
3. What's a fun fact?

Based on this feedback, Miranda would like more output under the habitats and animals sections. Here's the example she gave you of how the details should look for every habitat and animal.

Write functions that produce output that looks like the examples below.

### Example Output

Here's what it might look like (remember: sample data, not gospel truth):

```sh
***************************************************
*****              H A B I T A T S            *****
***************************************************

Pro tip: Double-check your output against the actual data! Miranda's original code might have some... creative errors.

After you nail the habitat details, do the same thing for animals:

```sh
