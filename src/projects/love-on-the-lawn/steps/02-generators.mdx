# Chapter 2 — HTML Generators

Working title: From Data to Display: Gnomes & Paperbacks

In this chapter you'll build two modules that convert the arrays from `database.js` into HTML strings.

Goals

* `lawnDecorations.js` — export `LawnDecorationsList()` which returns a string of HTML for the decorations list.
* `romanceNovels.js` — export `RomanceNovelsList()` which returns a string of HTML for novels.

Each function should:

* Import the appropriate getter from `database.js`.
* Build a string that contains a `<section>`, a heading, and a `<ul>` with `<li>`s for each item.
* Return the composed string (do not touch the DOM here).

End-of-chapter checklist

* Both modules export a function that returns HTML as a string.
* These functions are pure string builders and do not modify the page.
