# Chapter 5 — Inject into the Page

Working title: Happily Ever After… in `innerHTML`

Goals

* Use the `storeContainer` element and set `storeContainer.innerHTML = storeHTML`.
* Confirm the page renders the title, tagline, and both lists.

Example

```js
storeContainer.innerHTML = storeHTML;
```

End-of-chapter checklist

* Page shows the store title and tagline.
* Both lists render from the data in `database.js`.
