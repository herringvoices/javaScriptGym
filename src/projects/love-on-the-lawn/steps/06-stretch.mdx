# Optional Stretch Goals

These are optional features students can implement once the main flow is complete.

Stretch ideas

1. Staff Picks — add `staffFavorite: true` and show a badge.
2. Sold Out / Low Stock — add `stock` and display status messages.
3. Sorting — sort decorations by price and novels by title.
4. Category summaries — show counts or unique trope counts above each list.
5. Tiny CSS glow-up — tweak `styles.css` with colors, spacing, or badges.

Pick one or more to explore. They’re great for practicing conditionals, `.sort()`, and small DOM & data transformations.
