# Variables: boxes that hold information

So, JavaScript is a **toolbox for manipulating information**—data. To use those tools well, we need **easy labels** for the pieces of data we’re working with. We do this in real life all the time.

Imagine your friend Nick says, “I’m 35 years old.” Your brain makes a little box, writes **Nick’s age** on the label, and tucks that fact inside. Later, if someone asks, “How old is Nick?” you look back in your memory, find the box labeled “Nick’s age,” and read what’s inside.

That’s a **variable**: a labeled box that holds a value. The **label** is the variable’s name; the **value** is what’s inside.

## Build the box (declare), then peek inside

We build a box with the keyword `let`—a special, reserved word in JavaScript. Keywords are like command words: when you use one, the language does a specific built‑in job. In this case, `let` tells JavaScript to make a new variable.

### Name the box (the label)

After we build the box, we need to create a label for it—the variable’s name. Choose names that **say what’s inside** and still make sense a week from now. Imagine leaving a sticky note for future‑you and your teammates.

**Bad → Better (and why)**

| Bad                                                  | Better            | Why                     |
| ---------------------------------------------------- | ----------------- | ----------------------- |
| `nn`                                                 | `nickName`        | Says what it holds      |
| `c`                                                  | `favoriteColor`   | Specific, not cryptic   |
| `theNameOfTheUserWhoIsCurrentlyLoggedIn`             | `currentUserName` | Too wordy; hard to scan |
| `theTitleThatIsDisplayedAtTheTopOfTheCurrentWebpage` | `pageTitle`       | Concise and clear       |

Use **camelCase** for names:

* start lowercase: myName
* New words start uppercase: favoriteColor
* no spaces; don’t start with a number; avoid reserved words

Let's see an example:

```js
let myName;
console.log(myName); // undefined (box exists, but it’s empty)
```

## Put something in the box (assign)

After building your box, you use the **assignment operator** (the equals sign, `=`) to put a value inside it.

For example:

```js
let myName; // build the box (declare the variable)
myName = "Nick"; // put a value inside (assign)
console.log(myName); // "Nick"
```

The most important rule to remember is: **JavaScript always solves the right-hand side first.** It looks at everything to the right of the `=`—whether it's a simple number, a math problem, or other variables—and works until it has one single, final value.

Then, it takes that single result and stores it in the one variable (the "box label") on the left-hand side. The left side must always be a single box name, ready to receive the value.

For example, if the value you're storing is text, it must be wrapped in quotes (like "Nick").

Usually we assign variables a value when we first declare them. This is called **initializing**.

```js
let myName = "Nick";
console.log(myName); // "Nick"
```

## Changing what’s in the box (reassignment)

When you reassign a variable, you do not use the `let` keyword again. You’ve already built the box; now you’re just changing what’s inside. Using `let` again would tell JavaScript to try and build a new box with the same label, which usually results in an error.

```js
// 1. Build the box (declare) and put something in (initialize)
let currentScore = 100;
console.log(currentScore); // 100

// 2. Change what's in the box (reassign)
// Notice: NO "let" keyword!
currentScore = 150;
console.log(currentScore); // 150

// This would cause an error:
// let currentScore = 150; // ❌ SyntaxError: 'currentScore' has already been declared
```

Now, sometimes we don’t want a value to change. Think about a person’s birth date, the number of days in a week, or the name of your website. These things aren’t supposed to be reassigned later in the code.

When that’s true, we use a different keyword when we first declare our variable: `const`.

`const` is short for constant. It’s like you build a box, put something inside, and immediately lock the box and throw away the key. You can peek inside anytime, but you can never change what’s in there.

This gives us two keywords to declare a variable, depending on our intention:

* **`const` (constant):** Use this when you don’t plan to ever change what’s inside that box.
* **`let`:** Use this when the value might change later (like a `currentScore`).

```js
const siteName = "JS Handbook";
console.log(siteName);
// siteName = "New Name"; // ❌ TypeError if you try to reassign

let favColor = "pink";
favColor = "teal";         // ✅ value changed
console.log(favColor);
```

## Wrap‑up

You learned how to **declare** a variable, **name** it clearly, **assign** a value with `=`, and when to choose **`const`** vs **`let`**. You also saw `undefined`—what shows up when the box exists but nothing’s inside yet.

**Up next: *Data Types*.** That’s just “what kinds of things can go in the box.” We’ll start with text in quotes, then branch out.
