# Program Flow → Conditionals (Introduction)

In this section we'll introduce conditionals — the language features (if, else, else if) that let your program choose different actions based on booleans and comparisons. You'll learn the basic patterns and examples needed to make decisions in code; more advanced uses will be introduced later where they appear naturally in other chapters.
