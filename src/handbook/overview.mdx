### Start here

Each challenge tags the standards it reinforces. Skim the summaries in this handbook before coding, then keep the tab open as a quick reference.

### How to study

- Read the short tooltip copy for a refresher.
- Dive into the examples and pitfalls in this full entry when you need more context.
- Pair what you learn with the tests and DOM checks inside the challenge runner.

<Note>Bookmark sections you lean on often, and jot down your own notes right below the handbook content in a personal doc.</Note>

<Tip>MDX lets you embed interactive or styled components like this without leaving the content file.</Tip>
