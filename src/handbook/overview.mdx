title: How to use the handbook
short: Read this first when onboarding to the practice playground.
---

### Start here

Each challenge tags the standards it reinforces. Skim the summaries in this handbook before coding, then keep the tab open as a quick reference.

### How to study

- Read the short tooltip copy for a refresher.
- Dive into the examples and pitfalls in this full entry when you need more context.
- Pair what you learn with the tests and DOM checks inside the challenge runner.

<Note>Bookmark sections you lean on often, and jot down your own notes right below the handbook content in a personal doc.</Note>



## What JavaScript is (and isn’t)

JavaScript isn’t magic. It can feel that way at first, but it’s really a toolbox for manipulating data.

- Posting on Instagram → Create data
- Scrolling your feed → Read data
- Changing your username → Update data
- Deleting a post → Delete data

That’s CRUD, and it’s most of what we do. Our goal here isn’t to teach you every tool in the JavaScript toolbox. It’s to teach you the basic tools you’ll actually use—and when to use them.

## Handbook Challenges

Sometimes, you'll see amber colored boxes like this:

<HandbookChallenge title="Example">
	example

	{/* This small example just shows the look and feel */}
</HandbookChallenge>

These are little challenges for you to practice as you go. This is important: the only way to learn is to do. If you aren't practicing these concepts, you may feel like you get them in the moment, but they won't stick without practice.

There are no tests to run to see if your code is doing what it's supposed to. Instead, you will use your eyes to see if the result you get is the result you expect.

Also, don't feel limited to doing only what the challenges say! Explore, try new things, break old ones! Breaking things is one of the best ways to learn JavaScript.

## Your first tool: <code>console.log</code>

Think of <code>console.log</code> as your stethoscope—it lets you hear what your code is doing.

```js
console.log("Hello, handbook!");
```

You’ll use it constantly to check values, confirm what ran, and debug surprises.

<HandbookChallenge title="Console warm‑up" hints={[
	"Quotes mark text so JavaScript doesn’t think it’s a variable name.",
	"Reordering lines changes the order of output.",
	"A ReferenceError means a variable name wasn’t found (e.g., missing quotes)."
]}
	answers={[
		"console.log(\"first\");\nconsole.log(\"second\");\nconsole.log(\"third\");",
	]}
>
	<ol>
		<li>Log three words on three lines: <code>"first"</code>, <code>"second"</code>, <code>"third"</code>.</li>
		<li>Run and check the Console.</li>
		<li>Reorder the lines and run again. What changed?</li>
		<li>Remove the quotes from one line (e.g., <code>console.log(first)</code>). What error do you see, and why?</li>
	</ol>

	<p><strong>Expected console output (step 1):</strong></p>
	<pre>
first
second
third
	</pre>
</HandbookChallenge>

## How JavaScript runs (top → bottom)

JavaScript reads your file top to bottom, one line at a time. If line 3 uses something that isn’t defined until line 20, you’ll get an error.

```js
console.log(greeting); // ❌ ReferenceError: Cannot access 'greeting' before initialization
const greeting = "hi";
```

We’ll learn patterns that run code later (events, functions), but for now think of your file like a book: top → bottom.

<HandbookChallenge title="Order matters" hints={[
	"Define a value before you use it.",
	"Move the line that declares \"greeting\" above the line that logs it."
]}
	answers={[
		"const greeting = \"hi\";\nconsole.log(greeting); // hi",
	]}
>
	<ol>
		<li>Paste this code into the editor and run it.</li>
	</ol>

```js
console.log(greeting);
const greeting = "hi";
```

	<ol start={2}>
		<li>Now move the second line above the first so the value is defined before it’s used.</li>
		<li>Run again.</li>
	</ol>

	<p><strong>Expected console output (after step 2):</strong></p>
	<pre>
hi
	</pre>
</HandbookChallenge>

## Comments: notes for humans (and how to toggle them)

Programs are for computers and for people. Comments are short notes the computer ignores but teammates (and future‑you) will appreciate.

- Line comment: anything after <code>//</code> on a line is ignored
- Toggle quickly: press <strong>Ctrl+/</strong> (Windows/Linux) or <strong>Cmd+/</strong> (Mac) to comment/uncomment selected lines

```js
console.log("Visible");
// console.log("Hidden for now"); // toggled off with Ctrl+/ (Cmd+/ on Mac)
console.log("Still visible"); // end-of-line comment is fine, too
```

<HandbookChallenge title="Comment it out" hints={[
	"Use Ctrl+/ (or Cmd+/) to toggle the selected line.",
	"If something errors, comment it out and iterate."
]}
	answers={[
		"// console.log(first)",
	]}
>
	<ol>
		<li>Reproduce the earlier error by removing quotes: <code>console.log(first)</code>.</li>
		<li>Use <strong>Ctrl+/</strong> (or <strong>Cmd+/</strong>) to comment out that broken line.</li>
		<li>Run again — you should only see the lines that are still active.</li>
		<li>Toggle again to bring the line back.</li>
	</ol>

	<p><strong>Expected console output (after step 2):</strong></p>
	<pre>
first
third
	</pre>
