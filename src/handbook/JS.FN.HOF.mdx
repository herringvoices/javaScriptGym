# Functions → Next Steps (Higher-order & Advanced)

You’ve learned how to declare functions, give them parameters, and return values. That’s the hard part — you can now write small, useful helpers and compose them into real behavior.

There are more advanced function topics you’ll meet as you build programs:

* Callbacks and passing functions as values
* The difference between passing a value vs passing a reference (objects, arrays)
* Closures and lexical scope
* Higher-order functions (functions that accept or return other functions)

We’ll introduce these concepts gradually — not as standalone theory, but when they’re useful in other chapters and exercises. That way you see them in context and get hands-on practice.

For now: you’re ready to move on to conditionals. The next chapter shows how to use booleans and comparisons to choose different actions in your program (if / else). See the Conditionals section to continue.
