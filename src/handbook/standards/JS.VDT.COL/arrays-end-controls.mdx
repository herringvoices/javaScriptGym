title: Arrays · Add & Remove at the Ends
short: Use push, pop, unshift, and shift to append, prepend, and remove items from an array without manual index math.
---

# Data Types → Arrays (End Controls)

*Last time we* created **arrays of objects (playlists of songs)** so related fields travel together in order. *This time we’re* making that playlist behave like a real queue: add a song to the end, bump one to the front, or take something off—cleanly, without rebuilding the whole array by hand.

Up until now, we’ve changed array **values** in place (fixing a title at a specific index). But what about **changing the lineup**? Imagine tapping an “Add to queue” button, or moving a new favorite to the very start so it plays next.

Arrays give you built-in **methods** for these exact moves. A **method** is a function attached to a value, called with a **dot** and **parentheses**. You’ve used one already with `console.log(...)`. For arrays, the four end controls you’ll press most are:

* `push` — add to the **end**
* `pop` — remove from the **end**
* `unshift` — add to the **start**
* `shift` — remove from the **start**

We’ll try them one at a time.

## Add to the end with `push` (append)

`push` places one or more items at the **end** of the array.

```js
const songs = ["Sunset Drive", "Neon Rain", "Echoes & Honey"];
songs.push("Midnight Paper Planes");
console.log(songs);
// ["Sunset Drive","Neon Rain","Echoes & Honey","Midnight Paper Planes"]
```

answers={`const songs = ["Sunset Drive","Neon Rain","Echoes & Honey"];\nsongs.push("Midnight Paper Planes");\nconsole.log(songs); // ["Sunset Drive","Neon Rain","Echoes & Honey","Midnight Paper Planes"]`}

    Add a new song to the end of the playlist and log the result.

> <strong>Question for you</strong><br />
> Do <code>.shift()</code> and <code>.pop()</code> return anything? (Here’s a hint: they do.) See if you can figure out what they hand back when you call them.

## Remove from the end with `pop` (take the last off)

`pop` removes the **last** item and gives you something back.

```js
const songs = ["Sunset Drive", "Neon Rain", "Echoes & Honey", "Midnight Paper Planes"];
const removed = songs.pop();
console.log(removed); // "Midnight Paper Planes"
console.log(songs);   // ["Sunset Drive","Neon Rain","Echoes & Honey"]
```

> <strong>Anatomy of</strong> <code>const removed = songs.pop()</code><br />
> • <code>const removed</code> — you create a new variable named <em>removed</em>.<br />
> • <code>=</code> — the assignment operator says, “store the value on the right into that variable.”<br />
> • <code>songs.pop()</code> — you call the <em>pop</em> method on <em>songs</em>. It removes the last item, and the <strong>value it returns</strong> is the item it just removed.<br />
> • JavaScript evaluates the right side first, gets that removed item, and then <strong>stores that value</strong> in <code>removed</code>.

  "Call pop() with no arguments.",

  <p className="m-0">
    Remove the last track, save it in a variable, then log the removed track and the updated playlist.

  <pre className="m-0 whitespace-pre-wrap">{`Midnight Paper Planes
["Sunset Drive","Neon Rain","Echoes & Honey"]`}</pre>
</HandbookChallenge>

## Add to the start with `unshift` (prepend)

`unshift` places one or more items at the **start** of the array. Everything else slides right.

```js
const songs = ["Sunset Drive", "Neon Rain", "Echoes & Honey"];
songs.unshift("Intro (Live)");
console.log(songs);
// ["Intro (Live)","Sunset Drive","Neon Rain","Echoes & Honey"]
```

<HandbookChallenge
title="Prepend (add to the beginning)"
hints={[
  "Use unshift(\"Intro (Live)\") to add to the beginning.",
  "Check the first item afterwards with songs[0].",
]}
answers={`const songs = ["Sunset Drive","Neon Rain","Echoes & Honey"];\nsongs.unshift("Intro (Live)");\nconsole.log(songs[0]); // "Intro (Live)"\nconsole.log(songs);    // ["Intro (Live)","Sunset Drive","Neon Rain","Echoes & Honey"]`}
>

  <p className="m-0">
    Add a new opener to the beginning, then verify the first track and the updated array.
  </p>
  <p className="mt-3 mb-1 text-slate-300"><strong>Expected console output (example):</strong></p>
  <pre className="m-0 whitespace-pre-wrap">{`Intro (Live)
["Intro (Live)","Sunset Drive","Neon Rain","Echoes & Honey"]`}</pre>
</HandbookChallenge>

## Remove from the start with `shift` (cut the opener)

`shift` removes the **first** item. Everything else slides left, so indexes change.

```js
const songs = ["Intro (Live)", "Sunset Drive", "Neon Rain", "Echoes & Honey"];
const firstOut = songs.shift();
console.log(firstOut); // "Intro (Live)"
console.log(songs);    // ["Sunset Drive","Neon Rain","Echoes & Honey"]
```

<HandbookChallenge
title="Cut the opener"
hints={[
  "Call shift() and store what it gives you.",
  "After removing the first item, songs[0] is the new first track.",
]}
answers={`const songs = ["Intro (Live)","Sunset Drive","Neon Rain","Echoes & Honey"];\nconst removedFirst = songs.shift();\nconsole.log(removedFirst); // "Intro (Live)"\nconsole.log(songs[0]);     // "Sunset Drive"`}
>

  <p className="m-0">
    Remove the first track, log what you removed, and confirm the new first track.
  </p>
  <p className="mt-3 mb-1 text-slate-300"><strong>Expected console output (example):</strong></p>
  <pre className="m-0 whitespace-pre-wrap">{`Intro (Live)
Sunset Drive`}</pre>

## Practice: put it all together (with objects)

Same moves, now with records. Create your favorite song as an **object**, add it to the end, then pretend you clicked “Play”: take it off the end and place it at the beginning.

```js
const songs = [
  { title: "Sunset Drive", artist: "Axton" },
  { title: "Neon Rain",    artist: "Riza"  },
  { title: "Echoes & Honey", artist: "Palmer" }
];

// your favorite:
const fave = { title: "Midnight Paper Planes", artist: "Paper Planes Collective" };
```

<HandbookChallenge
title="Add, play, and reorder a record"
hints={[
  "Add your fave to the end with push.",
  "Remove the last item with pop and store it in a variable.",
  "Put that removed item at the start with unshift.",
]}
answers={`const songs = [\n{ title: "Sunset Drive", artist: "Axton" },\n{ title: "Neon Rain",    artist: "Riza"  },\n{ title: "Echoes & Honey", artist: "Palmer" }\n];\n\nconst fave = { title: "Midnight Paper Planes", artist: "Paper Planes Collective" };\n\nsongs.push(fave);                      // add to end\nconst nowPlaying = songs.pop();        // take off end\nsongs.unshift(nowPlaying);             // put at beginning\n\nconsole.log(songs[0]);\n// { title: "Midnight Paper Planes", artist: "Paper Planes Collective" }`}
>

  <p className="m-0">
    Add your favorite to the end, remove it to “play” it, and move it to the front so it’s first in line.
  </p>
  <p className="mt-3 mb-1 text-slate-300"><strong>Expected shape (first item):</strong></p>
  <pre className="m-0 whitespace-pre-wrap">{`{ title: "...", artist: "..." }`}</pre>
</HandbookChallenge>

> <strong>Pop quiz (pun intended)</strong><br />
> Earlier we asked whether <code>.shift()</code> and <code>.pop()</code> return anything. By now you’ve seen it: they hand you the item they removed. Stash it in a variable if you need to use it.

## Wrap-up

* Four end controls keep your playlist tidy:
  **`push`** (add to end), **`pop`** (remove last), **`unshift`** (add to start), **`shift`** (remove first).
* Methods are just functions attached to values, called with dot + parentheses (e.g., <code>songs.pop()</code>).
* These moves work the same whether your items are strings or full objects.
