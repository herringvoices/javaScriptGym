## Collections Overview

Collections (arrays and objects) let you group related primitives. Though this chapter sits inside the primitives section for now, it previews how primitives combine into richer structures.

```js
// Array of primitive strings
let colors = ["red", "green", "blue"];

// Object grouping primitive values
let player = {
	name: "Ada",
	lives: 3,
	isAlive: true,
};
```

Edit the examples: Add a color, change `lives`, and log a message describing the player using template literals.
