## String Values

Strings are text wrapped in quotes. You can use single (`'`), double (`"`), or backticks (`` ` `` for template literals). They let you label things, show messages, and combine pieces of information.

```js
let firstName = "Ada";
let greeting = "Hello, " + firstName + "!"; // concatenation
let greeting2 = `Hello, ${firstName}!`;       // interpolation
```

Try editing the examples in the editor pane. Change the value of `firstName`, add another variable for a last name, and build a full name string.
