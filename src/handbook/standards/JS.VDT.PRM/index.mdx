(# JS.VDT.PRM Introduction)

Welcome to the deeper dive on **Variables & Primitives**. This section breaks the big ideas into focused chapters you can complete one at a time. Start here to get oriented, then open the chapters in the sidebar.

### You will practice

- Declaring and assigning with `let` and `const`
- Storing and shaping strings, numbers, booleans
- Using operators (+, -, `===`, `&&`) and template literals
- Picking the correct primitive for a situation

> Tip: Keep an eye on error messages as you experiment—primitive mistakes (like missing quotes) are great debugging practice.
