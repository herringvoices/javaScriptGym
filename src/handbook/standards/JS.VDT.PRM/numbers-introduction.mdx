# Data Types → Numbers

Last time, we worked with **strings**—text in quotes—so we could label things and build readable sentences. Strings are great for names, messages, and anything you’d say out loud.

But sentences don’t add up. To do *real math*, we need our second data type: **numbers**. Now, I know some of us hear "math" and run screaming for the hills, but this won't be anything too scary—just the kind of simpe math your apps actually use.

Consider these problems:

* A customer wants to see the **total** for their order.
* A player **adds points** to their score in a web game.
* A theater shows how many **seats are left** in a row.
* A timer **counts down** to the start of class.

That’s numbers territory: counts, totals, and simple scaling. No calculus. No proofs. Just values you can calculate with so your app can answer “how many?” and “what’s the total?” without breaking a sweat.

## 1) Your first numbers

To make a number, you just type a numeral out without quotation marks. For example, `5` instead of `"5"`

Let's take a look at some numbers being assigned to variables:

```js
const redTeam = 5;
const blueTeam = 4;
console.log(redTeam, blueTeam); // 5 4
```

]}
answers={ <pre className="m-0 whitespace-pre-wrap">{`const redTeam = 5;
const blueTeam = 4;
let totalPlayers = redTeam + blueTeam;
console.log(totalPlayers); // 9`}</pre> }

	<p className="mt-3 mb-1 text-slate-300"><strong>Expected console output (example):</strong></p>
	<pre className="m-0 whitespace-pre-wrap">{`9`}</pre>
</HandbookChallenge>

## 2) Addition & subtraction

```js
let total = 0;      // start at zero
total = total + 3;  // add three
total = total - 1;  // subtract one
console.log(total); // 2
```

### Compound assignment (operators + the assignment operator)

We already learned that **`=`** is the assignment operator: **evaluate the right, then store in the left** (one box name on the left, a value on the right).

Compound assignment just **combines an operator with `=`** so you can update a variable in place.

**Rule for `=`:**
**“Evaluate the expression on the right down to _one_ value, then store that value in the variable on the left.”**

**For `+=`:**
**“Take the value on the right, add it to the value on the left, and store it.”**

```js
let total = 0;

total += 3;  // add and assign (same as total = total + 3)
total -= 1;  // subtract and assign
console.log(total); // 2
```

**Quick map**

* `x += y` → take left, **add** right, store in left
* `x -= y` → take left, **subtract** right, store in left
* `x *= y` → take left, **multiply by** right, store in left
* `x /= y` → take left, **divide by** right, store in left

> Same rule as before: JavaScript evaluates the **right-hand side first**, then assigns the result to the **single** variable on the left.

## 2.5) Numbers vs strings: "2" + "2" vs 2 + 2

<Callout type="caution" title="Same plus sign, different meaning">
If either side is a <strong>string</strong>, JavaScript will treat <code>+</code> as <strong>concatenate</strong> and glue text together. If both sides are <strong>numbers</strong>, <code>+</code> does <strong>addition</strong>.
</Callout>

```js
console.log("2" + "2"); // "22" (two strings concatenated)
console.log(2 + 2);       // 4   (two numbers added)
console.log("2" + 2);     // "22" (number becomes text, then glued)
console.log(2 + "2");     // "22"
```

<HandbookChallenge
title="Challenge: Try these additions"
hints={[
"Run the first example to see how JavaScript treats two strings with +.",
<pre key="peek" className="m-0 whitespace-pre-wrap">{`console.log("2" + "2"); // try this first`}</pre>,
]}
answers={ <pre className="m-0 whitespace-pre-wrap">{`console.log("2" + "2"); // "22" (two strings concatenated)
console.log(2 + 2);       // 4   (two numbers added)
console.log("2" + 2);     // "22" (number becomes text, then glued)
console.log(2 + "2");     // "22"`}</pre> }

	<p className="m-0">Console.log each of the following addition problems and observe what prints in the console. Note the difference between string concatenation and numeric addition.</p>
	<p className="mt-3 mb-1 text-slate-300"><strong>Problems to console.log:</strong></p>
	<pre className="m-0 whitespace-pre-wrap">{`"2" + "2"
2 + 2
"2" + 2
2 + "2"`}</pre>
</HandbookChallenge>

For now, keep it simple: **quotes = text** (glue with `+`), **no quotes = numbers** (add with `+`). We'll explore mixing types and coercion later.

## 3) Multiplication & division

```js
const seatsPerRow = 8;
const rows = 6;
const seats = seatsPerRow * rows;
console.log(seats); // 48
```

```js
const cookies = 24;
const kids = 6;
const cookiesEach = cookies / kids;
console.log(cookiesEach); // 4
```

<HandbookChallenge
title="T-shirt boxes"
hints={[
"Keep constants that don’t change as `const` (e.g., `shirtsPerBox`).",
"Use a new variable for the computed total.",
<pre key="peek" className="m-0 whitespace-pre-wrap">{`const shirtsPerBox = 12;
let boxes = 7;`}</pre>,
]}
answers={ <pre className="m-0 whitespace-pre-wrap">{`const shirtsPerBox = 12;
let boxes = 7;
let totalShirts = shirtsPerBox * boxes;
console.log(totalShirts); // 84
boxes = 8;
totalShirts = shirtsPerBox * boxes;
console.log(totalShirts); // 96`}</pre> }

>

	<p className="m-0">
		A customer orders 7 boxes of shirts. There are 12 shirts in each box. Create a variable named <code>shirtsPerBox</code> with the value <code>12</code> and a variable named <code>boxes</code> with the value <code>7</code>. Then calculate the total number of shirts, store it in a new variable called <code>totalShirts</code>, and <code>console.log(totalShirts)</code>. After that, the customer updates the order to 8 boxes — reassign <code>boxes</code> to <code>8</code> on the next line, and recompute <code>totalShirts</code>, logging the new total.

	<pre className="m-0 whitespace-pre-wrap">{`84
96`}</pre>

## 4) Order of operations (PEMDAS, lightly)

Multiplication and division are performed before addition and subtraction. To change that order, wrap the part you want evaluated first in parentheses—for example, write `(2 + 3) * 4` to do the addition before multiplying.

```js
console.log(2 + 3 * 4);   // 14
console.log((2 + 3) * 4); // 20
```

---

## Common gotchas (quick fixes)

* Don’t mix numbers with text (e.g., `"2" + 2` sticks them together as text).
* You can use decimals as well, but sometimes JavaScript does weird things with decimal math (e.g., `0.1 + 0.2` results in `0.30000000000000004`).
* Remember the assignment rule: **evaluate the right, then store in the left**.

## Wrap-up

You created and updated numeric values with **`+`**, **`-`**, **`*`**, **`/`**, and learned **compound assignment** (your new best friend for running totals).

**Next up: Booleans.** True/false values that power decisions.
